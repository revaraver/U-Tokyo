# For Professor Yusuke Miyao
###### I am very glad that you have come in. There are two parts below. The first part is my simple CV. The second part is project research plan with a lot of details. I prepared in English and Japanese respectively.
###### I think taking up a lot of your time is offensive to you if you are very busy, you don't need to look at the second part, and it doesn't matter to me. And I marked the important part in red.
#### 1.CV
##### For the CV, I have prepared English, Japanese, and Chinese in three languages.
