# For Professor Yusuke Miyao
###### I am very glad that you have come in. There are two parts below. The first part is my simple CV(including my transcripts). The second part is my project research plan with a lot of details.
###### I think taking up a lot of your time is offensive to you if you are very busy. If so, you don't need to look at the second part, and it doesn't matter.
###### In order to make your viewing easier, I have prepared three versions and two versions for these two parts. Their contents are exactly the same except for the language used.
###### You can view it by clicking the "+" in front of these headings. And I marked the paragraphs that I think are important in red.
#### 1.CV
###### For the CV, I have prepared three versions of English, Japanese and Chinese respectively.
