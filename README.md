# For Professor Yusuke Miyao
###### I am very glad that you have come in. There are two parts below. The first part is my simple CV. The second part is a personal introduction with a lot of details. I prepared in English and Japanese respectively.
###### I think taking up a lot of your time is offensive to you if you are very busy, you don't need to look at the second part, and it doesn't matter to me.
#### 1.CV
